# Doesnt work?
The version of [**Cuphead**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead/) this cheat is made for is v1.3.4, though it ***might*** work on other versions.

## How to fix uncompatible version
Here are ways to fix uncompatible cheat.

These fixes will require you to have [**Visual Studio**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed and **C++ Desktop Development** from the [**Visual Studio**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installer.

### Common Issue 1
There is an unlikely chance that it is due to the [**cuphead**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead/) game window having a different name. To check you can Alt + Tab while the game is open and you'll see the window name above said window. If it is different
#### Requirements
1. Click the green ***"<> Code"*** button above all the files and click ***"Download ZIP"*** in the little dropdown that appears.
2. UnZip the file and open the folder that appears.
3. Double click the ***"Cuphead External Godmode.sln"***, it should open [**Visual Studio**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
4. Open the ***"main.cpp"*** file in the solution explorer.
5. Head to line 82 and replace ***"Cuphead"*** to whatever name the cuphead window now had, ***it is case sensitive***.
6. Press Ctrl + B on your keyboard ( ***or head to build at the top and click "Build Solution" in the little dropdown that appears*** )
7. Wait for [**Visual Studio**](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) to do its thing and wait until it says **"========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped =========="**
8. The .exe file should be at **"Your folder\x64\Release"** ***or*** **"Your folder\Release"**.

### Common Issue 2
1. Im too lazy to write issue 2 it requires advanced knowledge of cheat engine and visual studio anyways just copy the code and do whatever its [**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) anyways.
